Not too far from across the globe another event in history was occurring that would forever change Greece. It was The Battle of Corinth, it involved the Roman Republic and the Greeks (Archaeans) of Corinth. The time period was 146 BC and the aftermath resulted in the city being left in rubble. The Greeks did not only lose this battle but took a catastrophic hit to their arts and studies. Many archaeologists say the loss took a toll on the civilization. "Corinth was utterly destroyed in this year by the victorious Roman army and all of her treasures and art plundered." (Wikipedia, 2022). Not only that but the Romans win over the city would then be the start of the Roman Greece empire.

The Romans went on with their path of destruction, winning over multiple Greek cities such as Scarpheia and Boeotia before finally making it to Corinth. Even after all the losses the Archaeans made one final stand at Corinth. Despite their efforts the Romans easily outnumbered and powered them dominating the battle. Archaeans men were killed, and the women and children were sold into slavery.   


All in all

During Julius Cesar reign Corinth was able to start rebuilding, ironically his success here was overshadowed by the destruction he is blamed for in Alexandria, Egypt. The Burning of the library is furthered explained on the next page and it shows their own loss of history and texts.
