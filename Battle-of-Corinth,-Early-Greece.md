Not too far from across the globe another event in history was occurring that would forever change Greece. It was The Battle of Corinth, it involved the Roman Republic and the Greeks of Corinth. The time period was 146 BC and the aftermath resulted in the city being destroyed. The Greeks did not only lose this battle but took a catastrophic hit to their arts and studies. Many archaeologist believe the loss took a toll on the civilization. "Corinth was utterly destroyed in this year by the victorious Roman army and all of her treasures and art plundered." (). Not only that but the Romans win over the city would then be the start of the Roman Greece empire.
