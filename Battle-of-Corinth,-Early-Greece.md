Not too far from across the globe another event in history was occurring that would forever change Greece. The Battle of Corinth, involved the Roman Republic and the Greeks (Archaeans) of Corinth. The time period was 146 BC and the aftermath resulted in the city being left in rubble. The Greeks did not only lose this battle but took a catastrophic hit to their arts and studies. Many archaeologists say the loss dismantled Greece. "Corinth was utterly destroyed in this year by the victorious Roman army and all of her treasures and art plundered." [Wikipedia, 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Corinth_%28146_BC%29). Not only that but the Romans win over the city would then become the start of the Roman Greece empire.

The Romans started on their path of destruction by winning over multiple Greek cities such as Scarpheia and Boeotia before finally making it to Corinth. Even after all the losses the Archaeans decided to make one final stand at Corinth. Despite their efforts though, the Romans easily outnumbered and overpowered them dominating the battle. Archaeans men were killed, and the women and children were sold into slavery. A Greek historian named Polybius, mentioned how careless the Roman soldiers were during the invasion. He watch them destroy works of art and treat them like objects of entertainment. It was said though how the Romans did show respect to the statues of Philopoemen, since he was the first ally of Rome in Greece. History is very unfortunate for these actions since many texts and knowledge were destroyed.

All in all the expansion of empires throughout time show how a lot of cultures arts and scholars go away. Through war, conquistador, and burning of books we see how academics can get lost in history. Many leaders steer their people to learn certain objectives and censoring math and science due to their own fear of what this knowledge can embark on. And unfortunaly the situation with the Archaeans is a perfect example of how this can happen. 


It wasn't until after a century did the city of Corinth begin to recover. While there is archaeological evidence of some minimal habitation in the years afterwards, it was only when Julius Caesar re-established the city as Colonia Laus Iulia Corinthiensis in 44 BC that it began to thrive again. During Julius Cesar reign Corinth was able to start rebuilding. Ironically though his success here is overshadowed by the destruction he is blamed for in Alexandria, Egypt. The Burning of the library is furthered explained on the [next page](https://github.com/lxg090/Group-1-Wiki-Project-/wiki/Egypt---Burning-of-The-library-of-Alexandria) and it shows their own loss of history and texts.
