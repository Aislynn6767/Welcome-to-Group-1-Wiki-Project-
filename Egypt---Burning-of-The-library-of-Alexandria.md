The Great Library of Alexandria was established around 285-246 BC and located in Alexandria, Egypt (wikipedia,2022). This Library along with its partnering branch Temple of Serapis was known to be one of the largest and most influential during its time. Within the library "over 100 scholars lived in the museum full time to perform research,write, lecture or translate and copy documents" (osu.edu, n.d). The library was the home of some of the "works by the greatest thinkers and writers...including Homer,Plato, Socrates" (Haughton,2011).

Interestingly enough there is a story told that the former ruler of the city, Ptolemy III, would take a hold of all documents of new arrivers. His scribes would make copies of them and deliver the copy to the original owner, and keep the original works in the library. Some may say it was "hunger for knowledge". However, it is believable that this was also a way to observe power through the collection of knowledge.

Unfortunately due to various changes of power in the city the library saw a decline and a great loss of meaningful texts. Many have pointed their finger towards Julius Caesar as the primary person in charge of its destruction. It occurred during Ceaser's Civil War in 48 BC, in the middle of chaos he ordered his soldiers to set fire to ships in the harbor. The fire spread towards the city and burned part of the library as well. It is said that "40,000 scrolls were destroyed in the fire started by Caesar" (Haughton,2011).

Another significant change was during the reign of Theophilus in 391 CE. Theophilus sent out orders for the Temple of Serapis to be destroyed and turned into a Christian church. Even though it is not proven to be true many believed that many scripts were taken and destroyed. It was "estimated to hold about 10 percent" of what the library held as a whole.
