# Burning of the Books - China 213 BCE
The first dynasty of Imperial China, know as the Qin dynasty, which lasted from (221-206 BCE). This dynasty was founded by the first emperor of the Qin dynasty, Qin Shi Huang. To strengthen their governing philosophy of Legalism, emperor Qin allegedly destroyed the philosophical treaties of the [Hundred Schools of Thought](http://en.chinaculture.org/library/2008-02/07/content_23009.htm) in 213 BCE and ordered the live burial 460 [Confucian](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/confucianism) scholars in 212 BCE . 

This event which was recorded by the [Han dynasty](https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-china/han-dynasty), became known as the burning of books and executing ru scholars. Although many modern historians questions the details of this story because the Historian, [Sima Qian](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sima-Qian), would have good reason to disparage the previous emperor to satisfy is own. Modern scholars established that Qin Shi Huang did have scholars killed but not by a live burial and that the scholars could not be Confucian as that school did not yet exist at that time. Also they established that the works that he found to be misleading or insurgent to be destroyed but did preserve two copies of each school to be in the imperial libraries.
